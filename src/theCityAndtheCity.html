<h2>Course Agenda</h2>
<p>The workshop will emphasize world building through themes of
automation and decentralization, constructing potential realities which
include buildings and landscapes, as well as finer grain details that
reveal behaviors and overall atmospheres through the use of video game
engines. Each group will be assigned a specific city and examine its
past, present, and future. Starting from a research-driven approach, a
specific topic distinct to each city will be established and form the
basis for determining what role architecture will play. Each team will
design two things: 1) an architecture that responds to the local
specifics of the city, 2) an interactive environment for their
architecture to exist in. These two will be generated through a
combination of simulations and generative algorithms that combine the
excesses of data and materials in tandem will seek to manipulate current
trends towards an alternate ending from what is currently predicted.</p>
<h2 >Methodology / Research
Direction</h2>
<p>Interactive Worlds (methodology/research agenda) When thinking of a
particular place, we are indirectly thinking of a network of logistical,
economical, cultural, environmental, and political processes. The course
will be focused on using ’world building’ and multi-dimensional
narratives as a way to reveal the imminent possibilities of our near
and/or distant futures. Using video game engines that combine
simulations and interactivity, the workshop will revolve around the idea
that "everything is connected" – environment, people, material, and
non-humans.</p>
<p>Some questions the workshop will investigate are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How will infrastructure necessarily be created and/or
adapted?</p></li>
<li><p>What effects will this have on architectural production,
habitation, and its environment?</p></li>
<li><p>What role(s) will ubiquitous data and sentience play?</p></li>
<li><p>What models of mitigation, resistance, and acceptance will
result, and from who/what?</p></li>
<li><p>How will these experiences be felt and through what
mediums?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 >Software / Skills Required</h2>
<p>A combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unreal - for interactive environments and video</p></li>
<li><p>Rhino - for basic modeling</p></li>
<li><p>Houdini and Blender - advanced modeling</p></li>
<li><p>Adobe Premiere - short videos.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 >Workflow Introduction</h2>
<h2 >Research</h2>
<p>Each team will start with a detective wall that develops a series of
relationships around particular #hashtags – these will serve as entry
points into a particular site or topic and will become the basis for
speculation.</p>
<h2 >Hashtags</h2>
<p>#Decentralization, #Automation, #Artificiality, #Artificial
Intelligence, #Copyright, #Cloud Seeding/homogenitus, #Archiving,
#Deforestation / Reforestation, #Anthropocene / anthropogenic
territories, #Ferality, #Carbon Offsetting, #Decolonization, #Non-Human,
#urk/urkopplad, #plantation forests, #antenna trees, #Uncanny
valley.</p>
<p>Research on these keywords can be conducted between news articles,
research papers, videos, etc. The idea is to move past the obvious
information and devise connections and potential narratives.</p>
<h2 >World Building the Real</h2>
<p>Teams will begin directly with building their worlds in the form of
landscapes, architecture, and assets.</p>
<h2 >Mutations / Speculations /
Iterations</h2>
<p>Using the research, narratives will start to be developed that will
guide the evolution of particular aspects of the world.</p>
<h2 >Interactivity and Effects</h2>
<p>Interactive virtual environments will be created to test the
performance of the devices/assets/architecture.</p>
<h2 >Film Trailer Making</h2>
<p>Scene development and narrative building into a short movie combining
multiple techniques (animations, compositing, etc.) to recount a future
story from either one or multiple perspectives.</p>

<h2 >General Schedule for
Student Development</h2>
<p>Note: Skills may shift around depending on progress. <strong>Week 1
(07/15)</strong> - INTRO TO PAST YEAR + DETECTIVE WALL + SKILLS</p>
<p>Overview of how last year’s projects evolved.  Research into assigned
city/topic and climate/socio-political projection. Initial skill
development of collaborative functionalities by making a small world in
Unreal. Bringing in assets, making an asset, and controlling lighting.
First assignment – recreate a scene and specific shot from an assigned
video. Every week, an upload is expected on the city&amp;TheCity <a
href="https://github.com/JorisPutteneers/TheCityAndTheCity" target="_blank">github</a>
page. More information surrounding the upload criteria will come soon.
